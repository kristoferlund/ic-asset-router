# 1.5 — Wildcard Segment Capture

**Phase:** 1 — Fix Foundations
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Not started

## Problem

A `/*` wildcard route matches any depth of path segments but returns empty `RouteParams` (`src/router.rs:102`). The handler has no way to know what path was actually matched.

Example:
```
Route:  /files/*
URL:    /files/docs/2024/report.pdf
Params: {}  ← empty, handler is blind
```

## Objective

Make wildcard routes capture the matched path tail and expose it to the handler via `RouteParams`.

## Specification

### Captured Parameter

The wildcard match should populate a well-known key in `RouteParams`:

```rust
// Route:  /files/*
// URL:    /files/docs/2024/report.pdf
// Params: { "*": "docs/2024/report.pdf" }
```

Use `"*"` as the key (consistent with the route syntax). Alternatively, consider `"__rest"` or `"__splat"` to avoid potential conflicts, but `"*"` is clean and intuitive.

### Router Changes

In `src/router.rs`, when the wildcard node matches:

```rust
// Current (approximate):
RouteMatch {
    handler: node.handler,
    params: RouteParams::new(),  // empty
}

// Target:
let remaining = segments[current_depth..].join("/");
let mut params = RouteParams::new();
params.insert("*".to_string(), remaining);
RouteMatch {
    handler: node.handler,
    params,
}
```

### Interaction with Named Parameters

A route can have both named params and a wildcard:
```
Route:  /users/:id/files/*
URL:    /users/42/files/docs/report.pdf
Params: { "id": "42", "*": "docs/report.pdf" }
```

Both should be present in the same `RouteParams`.

## Files to Modify

- `src/router.rs:102` — Add wildcard capture logic
- `src/router.rs` — Ensure `RouteParams` is populated on wildcard match

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/*` route captures the full remaining path as `params["*"]`
- [ ] Wildcard capture works at any depth (`/a/b/c/d` → `"b/c/d"`)
- [ ] Named params and wildcard capture coexist in the same route
- [ ] Empty wildcard match (e.g. `/files/` matching `/files/*`) produces `params["*"] = ""`
- [ ] Existing non-wildcard routes are unaffected
